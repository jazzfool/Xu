/*!
 * \brief Special immutable widget pointer wrapper which can nullify the pointer
 * before the widget is destroyed. This reasoning behind this is that there is
 * no way to know that a widget being pointed to (via Widget*) has been
 * destroyed. This simple wrapper class will listen for the event emitted by the
 * widget in its destructor and nullify the stored pointer. Therefore, when the
 * stored pointer is null, it can be checked for widget destroyal state
 * (otherwise not possible with a raw widget pointer).
